defineCMacro no longer exists:
-- blah.defineCMacro(..., null);
++ blah.root_module.addCMacro(..., "");

one of the other dependencies has a ** that should be a single *, just remove the &
-- foo(&val);
++ foo(val);

our build.zig specifies the linux backend in the options for raylib cuz I'm not running wayland, and the
default for raylib is to build for both for who knows what reason.
